After unzip the files, go to this current directory (where README.txt is), run script.m to generate a coverage report. Run ./+tests/SolverTest.m to test performance.

Hash Map -> myHashMap.m
Bloom Filter -> myBloom.m
Cuckoo -> myCuckoo.m
Unit tests -> ./+tests/SolverTest.m
command lines for generating coverage report -> script.m
a frequently reused hash function -> hash.m
some helpful data structures -> LinkedList.m, Node.m
A hash function written by D.Kroon University of Twente -> string2hash.m
(detailed reference in code file)
